Manual Step: Create a secret with credentials to pull images from registry.connect.redhat.com.

The different Red Hat registries are described here:
https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication
Note that registry.redhat.io is for Red Hat products, whereas
registry.connect.redhat.com (which we have to add) is for Third-party products.

Instructions for this step can be found in the OpenShift Quick Start guide:
https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/master/openshift-quick-start/#create-a-k8s-secret-that-contains-credentials-authorized-to-pull-images-from-the-registry-connect-redhat-com-repository

Use the documented name, "openshift-pull-secret", to work with subsequent scripts.

This is a different pull secret than the pull secret used to deploy the OKD cluster. 
That pull secret is associated with your user account.
This pull secret is associated with a registry service account. 
Registry service accounts are named tokens that can be used in environments 
where credentials will be shared, such as deployment systems.
That's from here: https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/
From there, you can create a New Service Account.

With the service account created, follow the rest of the steps in the Quick Start Guide
to add an additional authorization for registry.connect.redhat.com.
