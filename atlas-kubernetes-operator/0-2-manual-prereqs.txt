Prerequisite: Install or have access to a running Kubernetes cluster.

This repo was built and tested using MiniKube:
https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/
 - minikube start
 - kubectl get po -A
 - minikube dashboard --url
Once deployed, MDB-Atlas objects will be visible in the dashboard via the Custom Resource Definitions menu option. 

This was also tested using OKD. Just remember the Atlas API key must have an IP Access List entry
for the OKD node that is hosting the Atlas Kubernetes Operator.

The procedure to deploy MongoDB Atlas resources is taken from the Atlas Kubernetes Operator Quick Start:
https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/atlas-operator/ak8so-quick-start/


Manual step 1: Register for an Atlas account or log in.

Manual step 2: Create an API key.
